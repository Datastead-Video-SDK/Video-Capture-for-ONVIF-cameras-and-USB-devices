this is a very trivial compilation test:

- copy TVideoGrabber.h, TVideoGrabber.cpp in this folder
- depending if you are using MinGW32 or MinGW64, copy the corresponding x86 or x64 TVideoGrabber.dll in this folder
- open the minGW command prompt and go to this folder
- type "make" to build the executable
